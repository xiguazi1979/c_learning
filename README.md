# c_learning
Michael learns c programming
-
c_list: 

    good implementation for list, and list sort (merge sort), pragma syntax for debugging, define syntax for string paste.

c_basics:

    size_snprintf.c: Suggest try it in different platform, x86_32, x86_64 at least for int/long size. It shows snprintf() will not append '\0' if length to copy equals string dest length for your caution.
    02X_printf.c: %02X will output 2 hex

NOIP:

    CSPnote2022.md          - Note for CSP-J competition, what to be noticed
    NOIP_material           - Training knowledge material, and quiz collected from internet, not fully looked at but just for reference. Too large to upload thus saved locally by author
    Challenge_programming   - source code for a perfect algorithm book, good for OIer starter
    CSP_J2022               - source code practiced and won 2nd prize
    2023_coding             - source code practiced, not attended competition
    LuoGu                   - Since 2023/6, some LuoGu quiz practiced
    utility                 - Some useful skills like pbds, STL
