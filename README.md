c_list: 

    good implementation for list, and list sort (merge sort), pragma syntax for debugging, define syntax for string paste.

c_basics:

    size_snprintf.c: Suggest try it in different platform, x86_32, x86_64 at least for int/long size. It shows snprintf() will not append '\0' if length to copy equals string dest length for your caution.
